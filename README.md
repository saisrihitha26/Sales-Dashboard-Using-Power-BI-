# Sales-Dashboard-Using-Power-BI-

ðŸ“Œ Project Summary
->In this project, I developed an **interactive Sales Dashboard** in **Power BI** using the **Global Superstore** dataset. The main objective was to analyze sales performance across various dimensions such as region, product, and category, and deliver meaningful insights in a user-friendly format.

ðŸ”„ ETL Process
- **Power Query** was used to perform data cleaning and transformation tasks.
- Irrelevant columns were removed, data types were corrected, and missing values handled to ensure high data quality.
- Calculated columns and measures were created using **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** to support deeper insights.

 ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard Features
- **Key KPIs**: Total Sales, Profit, Quantity Sold, etc.
- **Slicers**: Filter by Region, Segment, Category, Year, and more.
- **Charts**: Bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to showcase trends and comparisons.
- **Interactive Design**: Allows users to drill down and explore data visually.

ðŸŽ¯ Outcome
The final dashboard helps stakeholders quickly understand:
- Regional performance trends
- Top-performing products and categories
